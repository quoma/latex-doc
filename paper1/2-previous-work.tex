There has recently been conducted a study that examined the case of transmission of resistant and susceptible bacteria in hospitals. The research of such processes is particularly important for understanding the nosocomial transmission rates of the bacteria. It is significant for the healthcare workers to be able to control the spread of resistant bacteria and reduce their antimicrobial resistance. The model may predict whether the usage of an antibiotic which does not have corresponding resistant bacteria present in the hospital will be useful to decrease the level of resistance in the examined bacteria.
