\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Hospital Model}

There has recently been conducted a study that examined the case of transmission of resistant and susceptible bacteria in hospitals. The research of such processes is particularly important for understanding the nosocomial transmission rates of the bacteria. It is significant for the healthcare workers to be able to control the spread of resistant bacteria and reduce their antimicrobial resistance. The model may predict whether the usage of an antibiotic which does not have corresponding resistant bacteria present in the hospital will be useful to decrease the level of resistance in the examined bacteria.

Antibiotic resistance is an increasing problem among the whole humanity. A solution for it still has not been discovered yet, therefore the optimal usage of the antibiotics is very important for our population. Antibiotics are very special type of medicine, which is used against bacterial diseases and often can be considered as the only posssible treatment for a patient. The chemical structure of antibiotics let them effectively devastate exponentially growing populations of bacteria. In order to treat a disease effectively, doctors prescribe a specific antibiotic with specific course of of usage. The antibiotics are usually need to be used specific doses within specific periods of time. The exact timing of treatment and accurate dosing of the medicine is very important for the right effect of the antibiotic. When patients do not adhere the prescribed conditions and rules of antibiotic usage, they allow the bacteria to develop an inmmunity against the antibiotic medicine. This is in fact an amazing biological property, which shows how living creatures are able to adapt to different murderous enemies and conditions.

One of the main reasons why antibiotics lose their effectiveness lies behind the filure to appropriately conduct the treatment course with an antibiotic. The schedule of antibiotic usage during the treatment course has been accurately developed by pharmaceutical specialists. The course is usually designed so that the population of bacteria is effectively reduced with the medicine. The doses of the antibiotic are not too much to potentially harm the patient's organism and are not too little to result in adaption of the bacteria. Adhering to the doctor's prescriptions in terms of timing and dosing is crucial for an effective and successful treatment of a disease. Individuals that do not adhere these rules and violate the prescription conditions are not only making their own treatment ineffective and even dangerous. They are also responsible for the process of antibiotic resistandce. By exposing bacteria to insufficient amounts of the antibiotic, a patient stimulates the natural ability of the organisms to develop some immunity mechanisms against the killing medicine. This way, irresponsible patients are strenghtening different dangerous microorganisms and reducing the power of the weapons that are used to fight against them.
