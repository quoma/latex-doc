\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Mathematical Model Description}

We are going to observe a mathematical model proposed by \cite{lips}, which describes the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistant infections in hospitals. The model examines a population of people in a closed environment, where new patients come into the system at some rate and go out of the system respectively. The model can be applied for the diseases that are transmitted through the skin, respiratory or digestive organs. A few examples of such bacteria are Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Klebsiella pneuoniae and others. The mentioned bacteria are dangerous enough to cause a painful or even lethal infection. The hospital environment was chosen because the transmission of these bacteria often takes place inside the hospitals. Different patients may accidentally contact with each other and spread their infections to one another, as well as to medical personnel. The medical workers are also often responsible for the spread of infections inside the hospital, since they may pass the bacteria between their patients. This might happen as a result of unsufficient hygiene with respect to their hands and inventory items.
