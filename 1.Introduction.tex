Efficiency and effectiveness are very important in any project. They determine the speed of moving towards goals and required resources. These concepts are affected by a number of various reasons including motivation of team members, project management methodology, ability to focus, etc.

There is a big number of different methodologies, motivational systems, personal efficiency / effectiveness trainings, etc. But in the study, conducted by Dean Spitzer, as many as 50 percent of workers said they only put enough effort into their work to hold onto their jobs. And 84 percent said they could work better â€”- if they wanted to. \cite{spitzer}

So the problem is clear: there is no complex solution, because of misunderstanding of how and why do parts of the ``project'' system relate to each other.

Chapter \ref{chap:techniques} contains an overview of modern iterative project management techniques.

Chapter \ref{chap:strategies} looks into team-motivation strategies, gamification and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's ``Flow'' theory.

The following chapters will consider market leaders (chapter \ref{chap:apps}) in productivity mobile applications. Takes a look at team-wide motivation techniques (chapter \ref{chap:building}) and suggests a new approach in task list description.

The last chapter contains a prototype and workflow description for the resulting application, based on the notion of ``flow'' and effective feedback mechanisms.
