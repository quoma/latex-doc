\section{Main Entities}

This chapter is going to describe the process of implementation, i.e. transition from a mathematical model to computer simulation. First of all we are going to create the basic elements that are essential to our model.

Here we can see how every entity is treated in AnyLogic. There have been created three stocks for three different groups of the hospital population. We name every stock as Susceptible, Uncolonized and Resistant. Each stock needs to have an initial value, which indicates how many individuals were present in each group at the beginning. We call these initial values S0, X0 and R0 respectively.

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/screens/basic/basic1}
        \caption{The properties of the Resistant stock}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad, \hfill etc.

        \caption{The properties of the Uncolonized stock}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Properties of the basic stock elements}
\end{figure}

In order to set the initial values to the stocks, we will need to create so-called parameters, which are bound to the created stocks. Each parameter holds a value that will be set to the corresponding stock. After the start of model execution, the value of the actual stock may change, independent of the parameter. Since the stocks that we have created represent the probabilities of any individual to fall into one of the categories (susceptible, resistant or uncolonized), they should sum up to 1. That's why we will set the initial values as 0.33, 0.33 and 0.34 (approximately equal values).
