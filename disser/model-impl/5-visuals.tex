\section{Visual Components for Data Analysis}

The AnyLogic simulation software provides a number of components for analysis of the simulation model. The list includes pie charts, bar charts, different plots and diagrams.

We are going to add a time stack chart in order to see the dynamics of different populations in the model. As it can be seen from the figure, we added Susceptible, Resistant and Uncolonized values to the time stack chart. The system automatically deduces that the names refer to the values of corresponding stocks, which were created earlier.

It is necessary to specify the scale of the time stack chart. Since we are observing the probabilities for an individual of falling into one of the three categories, we set the scale of the times stack chart to be from zero to one. This is because all of the probabilites should necessarily sum up to 1.

\end{figure}

We also set the data update settings of the time stack chart. Our chart will update the data automatically. We set it to display up to 400 last values of the stocks, since the width of the chart's "visible" area is equal to 400.

We can add another chart to visually differentiate the three stock values and their relative difference. In order to do so, we add a pie chart component, which shows the values of each stock as segments of one single circle. As we can see, we added Susceptible, Uncolonized and Resistant stock values to the pie chart as well.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The updating rate of the pie chart is almost the same as that of the time stack chart. There is one difference between them, which is that the pie chart displays data only for a particular moment of time, whereas the time stack chart shows the values for some range of time (in our case, of size 400).
