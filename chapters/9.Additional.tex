There is an ongoing problem of low performance and motivation at work. The objective of the dissertation was to explore modern project management methodologies and gamification theory in order to understand elements affecting performance of project participants and provide guidelines in order to increase their effectiveness.

Results of the research allowed to prototype a mobile productivity application, that uses the notion os ``flow'' and has effective feedback mechanisms.

The author of the master dissertation did a solid work, and constructed a good foundation on further work in the area of system thinking, motivation and productivity.

I recommend to evaluate the dissertation of Vadim V. Kotov as ``excellent'' and award him with a deserved qualification ``MSc in Information Systems'' by specialty 6M070300.

Rustem A. Kamun have made a solid work by researching business processes and their interaction in Web environment. I am sure that Rustem Kamun’s result is very valuable and actual for the Internet computing and Web services.
He carefully analyzed the issues of existing technologies, the issues of existing standards like WS-CDL and BPEL-WS and proposed the formal theory based on session typing.
Rustem A. Kamun confirmed the feasibility of the proposed theory by applying it in designing business protocols. He also received significant results by comparing the performance of Session Java with existing technologies.
It’s worth noting that Rustem's work has a huge impact on Web-service analysis and made a base for his future Ph.D.I recommend to evaluate the dissertation of Rustem A. Kamun as ``excellent'' and award him with a deserved qualification ``MSc in Information Systems'' by specialty 6M070300.

    Master's Dissertation of Vadim Kotov explores several project management methodologies (known as iterative) and gamification theory in order to understand elements affecting performance of project participants and provide guidelines in order to increase their effectiveness.
    
    This Dissertation introduces a complex overview of causes of emerging iterative methodologies, motivation management and the concept of ``Flow''. The resulting application prototype incorporates a very different approach and focuses on feedback.
    
    Dissertation consists of 5 chapters, presenting the necessary background combination of Project Management methodologies and psychological mechanisms behind motivation.
    
    In addition I wish to say that it is a very solid work. Results from the research could be used to stimulate not only project participants' performance, but also personal performance. The dissertation is a good starting point for many further researches on system thinking in project management.
    
    I recommend to evaluate the dissertation of Vadim V. Kotov as ``excellent'' and award him with a deserved qualification ``MSc in Information Systems'' by specialty 6M070300.
